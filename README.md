# KO Energy - Advanced Micro Wind Solutions

## Project Overview
KO Energy is a technology-first company developing high-performance, decentralized clean energy solutions. This project represents a complete transformation of the brand's digital presence, moving from a basic static site to a premium, "swanky" platform showcasing proprietary **INDRA** micro wind turbines and **AURA** hybrid inverter technology.

## Core Technology
- **INDRA Series**: High-efficiency micro wind turbines (1kW, 3kW, 5kW) engineered for noiseless, gearless operation with a 20-year lifespan.
- **AURA Inverter**: A wall-mounted 4-in-1 hybrid inverter designed for seamless wind, solar, and storage integration.

## Key Implementation Features

### 1. Visual Design & UI/UX
- **Glassmorphism**: Header and cards utilize `backdrop-filter` blur for a modern, high-end technical feel.
- **Dynamic Animations**: 
  - **Intersection Observer**: Implemented a smooth scroll-reveal system for all sections.
  - **CSS Transitions**: Fade-in and slide-up animations for an interactive loading experience.
- **Background GIF Integration**: The `.strip` sections feature `bgImage.gif` with a dark gradient overlay and `background-blend-mode` for depth.
- **Responsive Navigation**: Custom mobile hamburger menu with a slide-out interface and background lock.

### 2. Branding & Content
- **Proprietary Branding**: Global removal of all "OEM" and "Avantgarde" references. All turbines renamed to the **INDRA** brand.
- **Expanded Scope**: Content tailored specifically for **Residential (B2C)**, **Agricultural (Farms)**, and **Industrial** applications.
- **Coming Soon Landing Page**: `index.html` currently serves as a landing page, while `home.html` contains the full feature-rich site content.

### 3. SEO & Technical Marketing
- **Full Social Meta Tags**: Every page is optimized with Open Graph and Twitter Card tags for professional link sharing.
- **Semantic HTML**: Fully accessible using ARIA landmarks and logical heading hierarchies.
- **Search Presence**: Optimized `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt`.
- **Favicon Integration**: Branding consistently applied via high-resolution favicons.

### 4. Technical Stack & Dev Experience
- **Frontend**: Semantic HTML5, Modern CSS3 (Grid/Flexbox).
- **Scripts**: Centralized `assets/js/main.js` for modularity.
- **Dev Tools**: 
  - `package.json` configured with a `dev` script (`npm run dev`) using `live-server`.
  - Git initialized with a comprehensive `.gitignore`.
- **Forms**: Integrated with Netlify Forms for serverless enquiry processing.
